              <b>Purposes of this Policy</b><br />
              This Policy sets out how MediaPal collects and processes personal
              data about you when you visit the Website, and when we engage in
              marketing activities based on contact information you provide to
              MediaPal through other means described in this Policy. It also
              sets out our practices regarding our use of such data, the steps
              we take to protect it, the parties (if any) with whom we share it,
              and the choices and rights that you have regarding how we collect
              and process personal data about you.

              <br />You should read this Policy carefully so that you are fully

                >About Us</b
              ><br />
              MediaPal is an advertisement network that bridges the gap between
              publishers and advertisers by bringing advertisers to publishers
              (websites). As a Demand-Side Platform, our clients, which include
              advertisers and agencies, use our technology to purchase
              advertising, including display, video, native, and mobile ads, in
              an automated fashion.
              <br />MediaPal complies with the DAA “Self-Regulatory Principles
              for Online Behavioral Advertising”, their “Application of
              Self-Regulatory Principles to the Mobile Environment, and the
              “2018 NAI Code of Conduct”. We believe that these programs’
              principles help protect user privacy. <br /><b
                >How to contact us</b
              ><br />
              If you have any questions about this Policy, including any request
              to exercise your legal rights, please contact us via email to

              authority. We care about your privacy, and we appreciate the
              chance to address your concerns before you do so. <br /><b
                >Changes to the Policy</b
              ><br />
              MediaPal may from time to time revise this Policy. If we make
              revisions that materially change or affect whether or how we
              collect or use personal data, we will notify you by email (if, as
              a user of our Website or recipient of our marketing
              communications, you have provided us your email address) or by
              means of a notice on our Website prior to the change becoming

              <br /><b>Data pertaining to children</b><br />
              MediaPal’s products and services are not designed for children,
              and we do not knowingly collect personal data from or about any
              children. If we are made aware that we have received personal data
              from or about a child, we will use reasonable efforts to remove
              that data from our records.
              <br /><b>Links, other websites and other third parties</b><br />
              This Policy relates solely to the personal data we collect and
              process about you in relation to our Website, and other
              interactions you may have with MediaPal described in this Policy.
              MediaPal’s Website contains links to other sites, and the ads
              delivered may run on a variety of other sites. Clicking on those
              links, accessing other sites, or enabling those connections may
              allow third parties to collect or share data about you. MediaPal
              does not control these third-party sites and is not responsible
              for the privacy practices of such other sites. You should refer to
              the privacy statements of such third-party websites to find out
              how they collect and use your personal data and whether and for
              what purpose they use cookies. Also, as explained below, third
              parties may process personal data from you when you visit the
              Website. Such processing is governed by privacy statements of such
              third parties.

            <h4>2. The data collected via the Platform</h4>
            <p>
              While MediaPal collects certain categories of personal data in the
              course of delivering an ad to you, we do not intentionally collect
              data that reveals your real-world identity, such as your name,
              address, phone number, or any government identifiers such as your
              Social Security Number. Instead, MediaPal collects certain data
              about your computer or device through the use of cookies and other
              similar technologies, as explained below. <br />We may assign a
              unique identifier or ID to your browser, mobile device, or
              connected television when we serve an ad to it or you use it to
              access a client’s digital properties, including their websites,
              emails, apps, and websites, emails, and apps where their ads
              appear (“Digital Properties”). The unique ID enables MediaPal to
              determine within a reasonable level of confidence that a computer
              or device is the same as one previously interacted with. In some
              cases, based on third-party data, we are able to infer within a
              reasonable probability that a particular computer or device should
              be associated with the same unique ID. Also, our partners may
              provide us with associations that they have made based on data
              they collect from you. Where we are able to make such inferences,
              we may use this information to deliver targeted ads across
              multiple computers or devices. This is sometimes referred to as
              <i>cross-device advertising.</i> <br />The unique ID can be a
              cookie ID (a unique ID assigned randomly by MediaPal to an
              unrecognized browser), a mobile advertising ID (a unique ID
              assigned by the mobile operating system, e.g. Apple ID for
              Advertising or Android Advertising ID), an OTT TV Device
              Identifier for Advertising (a unique ID assigned by an OTT TV
              provider, e.g., Roku ID for Advertising), or a statistical ID
              (created by MediaPal). We use information about your computer or
              device to generate the statistical ID, including your operating
              system, user-agent string, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
              installed fonts, and similar information. This information makes
              your computer or device distinct enough for our systems to
              determine within a reasonable probability that they are
              encountering the same computer or device over time, including in
              environments where MediaPal cookies are not supported. <br />Your
              unique ID is associated with other categories of personal data
              that we collect about you. These categories include the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Bid Request Data and Impression Data:</b> MediaPal collects
                personal data about you when we have the opportunity to show you
                an ad on Digital Properties and when we deliver an ad. We refer
                to this data as Bid Request Data and Impression Data, and we
                receive this data from media supply sources, such as publishers
                (i.e. organizations who operate Digital Properties) and
                exchanges or supply-side platforms who display ads on
                publishers' Digital Properties. This data includes: your
                imprecise location (e.g., country, region, postal code), browser
                type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer); operating system
                (e.g., Mac OS or Windows); browser language (e.g., English or
                Spanish); IP address; Internet Service Provider and either a
                unique ID or an ID that one of our partners may assign to your
                browser or device, which we may associate with the unique ID
                that we assigned to your browser or device. It also may include
                Precise Location Data, such as GPS-level latitude-longitude
                coordinates or location-based radio frequency signal
                triangulation. When we process Precise Location Data, the mobile
                app publisher or other media supply source is responsible for
                enabling you to provide or withdraw consent with respect to the
                collection and use of your Precise Location Data. Please check
                the settings of the mobile app and your device if you would like
                to change your preferences in relation to Precise Location Data.

                <b>Pixel Data and Other Client Data:</b> MediaPal clients may
                collect data regarding your interactions with them when you
                visit their Digital Properties. We also may collect the same
                data when you visit the Website. This includes information such
                as the time you visited the site, the page URL, your IP address,
                your browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer), the
                operating system (e.g., Mac OS or Windows), the type of device
                you use (e.g. laptop or desktop), and data regarding your
                activities on the Digital Properties. MediaPal clients also
                mayalso collect hashed personal data that (if unhashed) would
                reveal your real-world identity, such as hashed email addresses.
                We refer to everything described above as Pixel Data. Clients
                also may import data that they have obtained outside the
                Platform, such as segments that our clients create or obtain
                independently from other third-party sources. Clients also may
                import data that they may possess or independently obtain
                offline, such as data regarding a purchase you made in the
                client’s store. The client’s offline data is first processed by
                a third party, which removes any data that reveals your
                real-world identity, appends a unique ID, and transmits the file
                to MediaPal for processing. We refer to this data as Other
                Client Data.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Third-Party Segment Data and Other Third-Party Data:</b> When
                they choose to provide it to us, we also receive personal data
                from third parties. We work with data providers who create and
                provide us with segments for our clients to use for advertising
                purposes. We refer to this as Third-Party Segment Data. We also
                send personal data to and receive personal data from third-party
                partners that allows them and/or us to associate the unique ID
                with those partners’ identifiers (through a process called
                “cookie syncing”) as well as data that associates your different
                devices with each other. We refer to this data in the Policy as
                Other Third-Party Data.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Special or Sensitive Categories of Personal Data:</b> We do
                not knowingly collect any special categories of personal data
                about individuals in the EEA, including: personal data revealing
                your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or

            <b>Creation of segments</b><br />
            <p>
              As described above, a segment is a grouping of users who share one
              or more attributes. Our clients may use health-related segments
              about non-sensitive conditions such as an inferred interest in
              health and wellness or cough medicine and allergy medications.
              <br />While MediaPal does not knowingly create segments that are
              based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for
              example, we do not create segments of EEA users based on personal
              data considered to be sensitive in the EEA, such as personal data
              revealing your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
              religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership,
              personal data concerning your health, sex life or sexual
              orientation, or genetic or biometric data), our clients may use
              the Platform to process some sensitive data, which may come from
              our clients’ Digital Properties or our partners. We take steps
              designed to ensure that this is done in compliance with applicable
              laws and self-regulatory guidelines, including through our
              contracts and policies with our clients and partners. <br /><b
                >Automated decision-making and profiling</b
              ><br />
              MediaPal uses proprietary algorithms to make decisions about
              whether or not to bid on opportunities to serve you ads and, if
              so, how much to bid. The ads you see are the result of client
              campaigns that specify how much to spend and on what basis to
              spend combined with the use of our algorithms. The ways in which
              we use algorithms to determine bid prices may be considered
              automated decision-making in certain jurisdictions. Additionally,
              these processes, in combination with client campaigns described
              below, may constitute profiling in certain jurisdictions.
              <br />As explained above, we assign a unique ID to your browser or
              device. Using proprietary technology, we associate data that we
              collect about you with this unique ID and create segments using
              inferred details about certain of your preferences, behaviors, and
              demographic information. Many of our clients’ campaigns rely on
              such segments. If MediaPal receives an opportunity to show you an
              ad on a publisher’s website or in a publisher’s app, that client
              may be one of the many who are eligible to bid to serve an ad to
              you. <br />The automated processes that we use do not affect your
              legal rights (such as your right to vote, take legal action, or
              freely associate with others) or your ability to receive social
              benefits or obtain citizenship, nor do they have legal effects on
              you. Also, we do not knowingly process or make automated decisions
              about EEA users based on any data that falls into special
              categories in the EEA. As described below, you have the right to
              object to this automated processing at any time and you may have
              additional rights.<br />
              <b>Legal basis for processing</b><br />
              Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data
              described above will depend on the personal data concerned and the
              specific context in which we process it. However, we will normally
              collect personal data from you only where the processing is in our
              (or a third party's, such as our clients’) legitimate interests
              and not overridden by your rights, such as your right to opt out.
              If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our
              legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest
              will normally be to operate the Platform and serve you ads on
              behalf of our clients. We may have other legitimate interests and,
              if appropriate, we will make clear to you at the relevant time
              what those legitimate interests are.
              <br />
              <b>Opt-out and choice mechanisms</b><br />
              If you want to limit the data MediaPal collects and processes
              about you and want us not to target ads that are based on your
              interests to your browsers or devices, you may opt out from
              MediaPal tracking and interest-based advertising at any time. If
              you opt out, you will still see ads, but those ads are not likely
              to have anything to do with products or services you care about.
              With interest-based advertising, you receive ads and offers that
              are more likely to be useful to you.<br />
              If you use multiple browsers or devices and wish to limit the data
              MediaPal collects and processes and do not wish to receive
              MediaPal interest-based advertising on any of them, you must opt
              out from each browser and device individually.<br />

              <br />We will retain all other categories of personal data that we
              collect or receive, including Bid Request Data and Impression
              Data, Pixel Data and Other Client Data, and Third-Party Segment
              Data and Other Third-Party Data, for no longer than thirteen
              months, and we retain much of this data for shorter periods of
              time. Furthermore, we may delete personal data in response to a
              request from a user under applicable law or when contracts with
              our clients end. Also, most cookies expire within thirteen months,
              while certain cookies that are not used for tracking are refreshed
              for as long as such cookies are necessary for our legitimate
              business purposes.

              This Website uses technologies such as cookies, pixels, and
              scripts, which are placed by MediaPal and our affiliates,
              partners, and other service providers (e.g., video providers and
              email service providers). These technologies collect information
              to improve the functionality of our Website, analyze trends,
              administer the Website, track a visitor’s movements around the
              Website and to gather information about our Website visitors as a
              whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these
              technologies by these companies on an individual as well as
              aggregated basis. <br />We also partner with one or more
              third-party ad networks to either display advertising on our
              Website or to manage our advertising on other websites. Our ad
              network partners use cookies, pixels, and other ad-targeting
              technologies to collect information about your activities on our
              Website to provide you with targeted advertising based upon your
              interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the
              purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt out of
              interest-based advertising by using the Network Advertising
              Initiative opt-out tool. Please note that you will still see ads
              if you opt out. The ads will just not be as relevant to you.
              <br />Additionally, some of our third-party service providers may
              use Flash cookies to collect and store information for purposes
              similar to the above. <br />Below is a list of cookies that are

              may result in additional cookies and scripts appearing on the
